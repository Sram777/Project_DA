# Project_DA
Tried Data visualization on the data I collected


Data Set: 

The data used for the project was collected using a google form which was circulated among the users of various Programming Languages. Data was collected for the following Features.

•	Name
•	Email
•	Student or Working Professional
•	College Name(The last Academic Institution)
•	Current Job Title (or) Future Job Title
•	Programming Language Mostly Used



Task 1: Bar chart describing Programming Language usage according to career

Taking the features of Job Title and Programming Language we visualize the data in the form of bar charts. The observations were maximum people use Python and it’s heavily used in Data Science and individuals who are into Web Development use JavaScript as their preferred Language.


Task 2: Scatter plot describing College and various Career paths

In the diagram in the excel Sheet we observe the data to be represented in the (x,y) fashion and each career path is denoted by a different shade of color. The number in x represents the college corresponding to the data point among the 26 colleges in our data set. The y represents the number of individuals working/going to work in that field


Task 3: Bar plot describing Preference of Programming Language differing among students and Professionals
In this case we used a Bar Chart because it is best suited to depict differences and it gives a better understanding through visualization compared to others. We observe Python is the most popular Language among Professionals and students.
